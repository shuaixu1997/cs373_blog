## WEEK-THREE

### What did you do this past week?

What an exhausting week! I attended the engineering expo, did poorly in an interview and finished the first round of assignment dues. I need to get into this rhythm though, as the CNS career fair is on the way and I don't want to screw up another opportunity. Job hunting is hard.

### What's in your way?

Collatz is done; So I have algo homeworks and data management lab to worry about. Meanwhile I want to start early on my stats homework and history essay so that I can save some time for future interviewings. I guess I won't be having any spare time then.

### What will you do next week?

As I said, balance the school works and the interview preps. I still have my weekly routine going, but I might choose to opt out some lectures. Hopefully this will be alright. Sometimes I feel like I'm back to the internship hunting season paired with 439 last semester. It's more pressured this time, yet I can see myself growing and get strong enough to get through this.

### What's your experience of the (in-class exercise) class?

EDIT: Well. For in-class exercise, I have experienced it last semester in OOP. The collaboration part is great as we need to speak out our thought process and try to understand where the other people is getting at. Just like next week's assigned reading for pair programming advice, the in-class exercise at least motivates me to actively participate.   

I like the class as always. Pretty sure the lectures are still similar to the OOP ones, just replacing C++ with Python. It's always good to know those subtle differences between languages and keep brushing up on it. 

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

I know this was mentioned in class, yet I still want to share my experience with docker this week. For my data management class, we were asked to install prosgressql and pgadmin for our homeworks. Personally I use a Ubuntu machine so it turns out that I don't have a desktop version available. I decided to take advantage of my linux system and instead of installing packages one by one, I just pulled a docker image containing all setups. I launched the project in the background and bind a port to the pgadmin interface, and as simple as that I got a working pgadmin just functioning like a normal web page. Seriously I can see the future of docker! No more manual environmental configurations.

## WEEK-TWO

### What did you do this past week?

Thanks to the labor day vacation, this week feels much shorter. I spent most of my time preparing for my first interview in this semester, and I have not heard anything back yet. I also worked on the Collatz project and finished most of them. Passing the HackerRank is a little tougher than I expected, but I'm glad that I get it over in this weekend.

### What's in your way?

Projects and assignments are out there waiting for my work. I feel like I installed so many tools this week, including the latex setup for algorithm, the R packages for stats, the Gitlab configuration for this class and Postgres/pgadmin for data management. Getting exposed to new things will take some time, and I hope it will be smooth when I actually start using them soon.

### What will you do next week?

I need to finish my homework for algo & database before Wednesday and then definetely add the unit/acceptance tests with formatting stuff to close the Collatz project. Meanwhile, I will probably hand in my resume to a few companys in the engineering career fair to see if there's more opportunity. Of course the CNS one would be huge the week after and nobody wants to miss that, so the engineering one next week could be a good place to have some tastes.

### What's your experience of the class?

It's pretty good. Since I took the OOP last semester, most of the content this week sounds kind of familiar to me. Comparing to the lectures, I'm more excited on what would happen for the group project. How many hours should I expect to spend with my teammates? What are we building and what would it look like? As for the Collatz project experience, I find the Gitlab CI very easy to use. I didn't even have to modify the configuration file at all, and it pulls of my changes and finishes the testing in literally two minutes.   

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

The Overleaf platform. I was kind of trying to avoid the LaTex work earlier in my college career, yet the requirement that I have to type my homework leaves me no choice now. So the Overleaf platform is free and we can save our projects online without worring about losing the data at all. I can also access it whichever laptop I'm using. In terms of the functunality, the dual view makes the compiling & preview much simpler. What I need to do is simply copy and paste the symbols from the raw Tex source based on the preview, so we won't be scrolling in Word to find out a no-name-symbol among tons of similar ones any more. Yay!

## WEEK-ONE

### What did you do this past week?

It's the first week so a lot of new things going on. I finalized my course selections and began getting used to the new schedule I have in this semester. Most of my college friends are getting back in town earlier this week, so I got some chance to hang out with them and met some new people. It's pretty awesome. I'm so ready for this new start.

### What's in your way?

As I'm becoming a rising senior, the job hunting is definitely the task staying on top of my priority list. Career fairs are coming in a few weeks so I need to get ready for the interview stuff, including updating my resume, looking for opportunities and brush up my coding skills etc. Meanwhile I just got started on my part-time job, which also requires me to put in more effort at the beginning. So I guess I will figure out how to balance my life as I go.

### What will you do next week?

Just the transition from the relaxing summer mode to a busy working mode. I like this labor day long weekend so that I can adjust a bit and make up some plans. Going over all my syllabi for this semester, I realize that this CS373 is probably the most time consuming class for me. I'm not too worried about the workload since I already have some experience doing web dev things, yet I think I still need to reach out to find and get to know my teammates a bit.

### What are your expectations of the class?

The most exciting part should be the collaboration on the group project. I enjoy doing an independent project as we will have the freedom to design and implement anything we want from scratch, which brings in a great sense of accomplishment. Also I decided to use Python for most of my interviews, so the lecture will certainly be helpful in this perspective. Lastly, I enjoy professor Downing's lectures very much ever since the first week of OOP I took last semester, so this class should be at least as enjoyable as I expected.   

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

I didn't know that Gitlab has this CI thing built-in already. This is so cool. I can't wait to try it out pretty soon, as the previous experience using Travis.ci is not as smooth as I expected it to be. This summer I got in touch with Jenkins, which is quite flexible and works fine. So I guess I'm in a good place to start comparing these tools and summarize what is my preferrence and how these tools differ in terms of automation in a general way.
