## WEEK-FIVE

### What did you do this past week?

I had a bunch of interviews earlier this week and spent most of my weekend setting up our web application and server stuff. The work on back end server is actually ahead of game here, but I believe it would save us time when it comes to scraping and populating into database.     

### What's in your way?

I will have my first algorithm exam tomorrow. The materials are kind of confusing so I definitely need to figure them out. After that it's the project phase one due, which we already finished most parts of it. 

### What will you do next week?

Well I should be expecting some results from the previous interviews. I really want to take a break at this point, but if I move forward to the onsite interviews that would be even more stressful than the on-campus ones. I always feel like I'm not ready enough for the whiteboard coding, yet I just have to overcome this fear somehow. 

### What's your experience of the readings, so far? And, if you went, what did you think of the talk by Under Armour? (this question will vary, week to week)

Some of the readings are really conceptual, like the UML ones. I didn't dig into some concepts because I feel like they are not quite directly related to our lectures and projects. Of course it is really helpful in terms of my software engineering experience, but I have to admit that I am putting the lecture/project on a much higher priority over the readings so far. As for the tech talk, I'm glad that we always have this kind of opportunity to get some real world information. (And the free attendance quiz!) 

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

I will share my experience with AWS EC2. My first try was on freshman year, and the experience was horrible cos I didn't really know anything about it. Over the few years I've gained some cloud computing experience, yet never work with AWS ever since. This time I notice that the interfaces change a lot, and it still looks like over complicated for someone just started. I guess all the tools are somehow similar once we grab the concept under the hood, so my advice is to try more platforms so that we will know which feature or functionality is important and what specs can we simply ignore.

-----------------------------------------------------------


## WEEK-FOUR

### What did you do this past week?

Career fair! I did spend a lot time preparing for this and of course it was exhausting. Then I finished my first on-campus interview in this semester, and tried hard to catch up with the coursework I've missed. I also participate in our first group meeting for the upcoming web app project. Looks like we are an enthusiastic team planning ahead of time while the project specs is still on the way!

### What's in your way?

A series of interviews coming up. I definitely need to spend more time brushing up the data structure/algorithm materials and do some mock-ups on writing code in a white board. I have done one interview this week, and still I don't really feel comfortable writing using a marker instead of typing in a keyboard. I guess the main difference is that we lose the track of formatting and it becomes significantly harder to insert a statement between two lines that have been written. 

### What will you do next week?

I will certainly miss some classes but I really want to make up for it. So after I'm done with the first-round interviews, I'll probably go over the slides and docs in detail. It will be the end of September now, and I do have plenty of materials to review. This would also save me some time later when the midterm comes up, so that I won't feel screwed and have no time for schooling at all.

### What was your experience of Project #1 (the problem, the overkill requirements of submission, etc.)?

Not too much. I had OOP last semester so this entire experience is quite familiar to me. One thing I do like about it is the CI/CD integration: it is much faster than the Travis.ci that we were using before! The submission is also a little bit different as we are not required to put the details into a json file.

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Hey I don't know if this is relevant enough, but I do want to share this trick that greatly boosts my energy level recently: change the physical environment frequently. Like you don't necessary have to go to the library or sit right on your desk chair; anywhere, a sofa, under a tree or even holding your paper while randomly walking around. All of this strangely works for me. It might not be as comfortable as my usual study place, but I feel like I can concentrate more and get short tasks done for around half an hour. 


-----------------------------------------------------------

## WEEK-THREE

### What did you do this past week?

What an exhausting week! I attended the engineering expo, did poorly in an interview and finished the first round of assignment dues. I need to get into this rhythm though, as the CNS career fair is on the way and I don't want to screw up another opportunity. Job hunting is hard.

### What's in your way?

Collatz is done; So I have algo homeworks and data management lab to worry about. Meanwhile I want to start early on my stats homework and history essay so that I can save some time for future interviewings. I guess I won't be having any spare time then.

### What will you do next week?

As I said, balance the school works and the interview preps. I still have my weekly routine going, but I might choose to opt out some lectures. Hopefully this will be alright. Sometimes I feel like I'm back to the internship hunting season paired with 439 last semester. It's more pressured this time, yet I can see myself growing and get strong enough to get through this.

### What's your experience of the (in-class exercise) class?

EDIT: Well. For in-class exercise, I have experienced it last semester in OOP. The collaboration part is great as we need to speak out our thought process and try to understand where the other people is getting at. Just like next week's assigned reading for pair programming advice, the in-class exercise at least motivates me to actively participate.   

I like the class as always. Pretty sure the lectures are still similar to the OOP ones, just replacing C++ with Python. It's always good to know those subtle differences between languages and keep brushing up on it. 

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

I know this was mentioned in class, yet I still want to share my experience with docker this week. For my data management class, we were asked to install prosgressql and pgadmin for our homeworks. Personally I use a Ubuntu machine so it turns out that I don't have a desktop version available. I decided to take advantage of my linux system and instead of installing packages one by one, I just pulled a docker image containing all setups. I launched the project in the background and bind a port to the pgadmin interface, and as simple as that I got a working pgadmin just functioning like a normal web page. Seriously I can see the future of docker! No more manual environmental configurations. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


## WEEK-TWO

### What did you do this past week?

Thanks to the labor day vacation, this week feels much shorter. I spent most of my time preparing for my first interview in this semester, and I have not heard anything back yet. I also worked on the Collatz project and finished most of them. Passing the HackerRank is a little tougher than I expected, but I'm glad that I get it over in this weekend.

### What's in your way?

Projects and assignments are out there waiting for my work. I feel like I installed so many tools this week, including the latex setup for algorithm, the R packages for stats, the Gitlab configuration for this class and Postgres/pgadmin for data management. Getting exposed to new things will take some time, and I hope it will be smooth when I actually start using them soon.

### What will you do next week?

I need to finish my homework for algo & database before Wednesday and then definetely add the unit/acceptance tests with formatting stuff to close the Collatz project. Meanwhile, I will probably hand in my resume to a few companys in the engineering career fair to see if there's more opportunity. Of course the CNS one would be huge the week after and nobody wants to miss that, so the engineering one next week could be a good place to have some tastes.

### What's your experience of the class?

It's pretty good. Since I took the OOP last semester, most of the content this week sounds kind of familiar to me. Comparing to the lectures, I'm more excited on what would happen for the group project. How many hours should I expect to spend with my teammates? What are we building and what would it look like? As for the Collatz project experience, I find the Gitlab CI very easy to use. I didn't even have to modify the configuration file at all, and it pulls of my changes and finishes the testing in literally two minutes.   

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

The Overleaf platform. I was kind of trying to avoid the LaTex work earlier in my college career, yet the requirement that I have to type my homework leaves me no choice now. So the Overleaf platform is free and we can save our projects online without worring about losing the data at all. I can also access it whichever laptop I'm using. In terms of the functunality, the dual view makes the compiling & preview much simpler. What I need to do is simply copy and paste the symbols from the raw Tex source based on the preview, so we won't be scrolling in Word to find out a no-name-symbol among tons of similar ones any more. Yay!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

## WEEK-ONE

### What did you do this past week?

It's the first week so a lot of new things going on. I finalized my course selections and began getting used to the new schedule I have in this semester. Most of my college friends are getting back in town earlier this week, so I got some chance to hang out with them and met some new people. It's pretty awesome. I'm so ready for this new start.

### What's in your way?

As I'm becoming a rising senior, the job hunting is definitely the task staying on top of my priority list. Career fairs are coming in a few weeks so I need to get ready for the interview stuff, including updating my resume, looking for opportunities and brush up my coding skills etc. Meanwhile I just got started on my part-time job, which also requires me to put in more effort at the beginning. So I guess I will figure out how to balance my life as I go.

### What will you do next week?

Just the transition from the relaxing summer mode to a busy working mode. I like this labor day long weekend so that I can adjust a bit and make up some plans. Going over all my syllabi for this semester, I realize that this CS373 is probably the most time consuming class for me. I'm not too worried about the workload since I already have some experience doing web dev things, yet I think I still need to reach out to find and get to know my teammates a bit.

### What are your expectations of the class?

The most exciting part should be the collaboration on the group project. I enjoy doing an independent project as we will have the freedom to design and implement anything we want from scratch, which brings in a great sense of accomplishment. Also I decided to use Python for most of my interviews, so the lecture will certainly be helpful in this perspective. Lastly, I enjoy professor Downing's lectures very much ever since the first week of OOP I took last semester, so this class should be at least as enjoyable as I expected.   

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

I didn't know that Gitlab has this CI thing built-in already. This is so cool. I can't wait to try it out pretty soon, as the previous experience using Travis.ci is not as smooth as I expected it to be. This summer I got in touch with Jenkins, which is quite flexible and works fine. So I guess I'm in a good place to start comparing these tools and summarize what is my preferrence and how these tools differ in terms of automation in a general way.
