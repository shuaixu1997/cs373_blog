## WEEK-ONE

### What did you do this past week?

It's the first week so a lot of new things going on. I think I finalized my course selections and began getting used to the new schedule I have in this semester. Since generally students are getting back in town this week, I got some chance to hang out with my college friends and met some new people. It's pretty awesome. I'm so ready for this new start.

### What's in your way?

As I'm becoming a rising senior, the job hunting is definitely the task staying top on my priority list. Career fairs are coming in a few weeks so I need to get ready for the interview stuff, including updating my resume, looking for opportunities and brush up my coding skills etc. Meanwhile I just got started on my part-time job, which also requires me to put in more effort at the beginning. So I guess I will figure out how to balance my life as we go.

### What will you do next week?

Just the transition from the relaxing summer mode to a busy working mode. I like this labor day long weekend so that I can adjust a bit and make up some plans. Going over all my syllabi for this semester, I realize that this CS373 is probably the most time consuming class for me. I'm not too worried about the workload since I already have some experience doing web dev things, yet I think I still need to reach out to find and get to know my teammates a bit.

### What are your expectations of the class?

The most exciting part should be the collaboration on the group project. I enjoy doing an independent project very much as we will have the freedom to design anything we want from scratch, which gives out a great sense of accomplishment. Also I decided to use Python for most of my interviews, so the lecture will certainly be helpful in this perspective. Lastly, I enjoy professor Downing's lectures very much since the last semester when I was taking the OOP, so this class should be at least as enjoyable as I expected.   

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

I didn't know that Gitlab has this CI thing built-in already. This is so cool. I can't wait to try it out pretty soon, as the previous experience using Travis.ci is not as smooth as I expected it to be. This summer I got in touch with Jenkins, which is quite flexible and works fine. So I guess this will be a good place for me to compare these tools and summarize what is my preferrence and how these tools differ in terms of automation in a general way.
