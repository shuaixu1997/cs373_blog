## WEEK-THIRTEEN

### What did you do this past week?

I went out of town since last Sunday and had an onsite interview on Tuesday. I took an overnight flight getting back to Austin, which completely messed up my sleeping schedule in this week. I did catch some sleep during the flight, yet I was so hungry all night long and all they have is cookie... anyway I still finished a full day schedule on Wednesday after arriving early in the morning, and I definitely overslept throughout the rest of the week.

### What's in your way?

Our team is so lucky to have Friday for presentation, so it gets us a lot of time for preparation. I have two major assignments due in this upcoming week, so that would take up some time.

### What will you do next week?

Next week is technically the last week of lectures. I will try to attend all of them, as I'm expecting some final review sessions going on and I can catch up a little bit. The week after next week is horrible for me since I have four exams in a row and I'm still not sure what time is one of the made up session (I have one conflict on schedule).

### If you went, what did you think of the talk by Google? (this question will vary, week to week)

Unfortunately I didn't go.

### What was your experience of the refactoring topics? (this question will vary, week to week)

Refactoring lectures are interesting. I definitely had some experience refactoring codes, either in schoolwork or during internships. However, I never treated refactoring in a systematic way; I always modifying codes as I wish and never thought about consequences (assuming we can always roll back...). Now I agree that it's a bad habit and I might have a big trouble if I did this to a complicated industrial production code. I like the practice on lectures: the implementations are easy but the most beneficial part is to grasp the idea and understand why we are doing that. 

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week? 

During Thanksgiving I discovered an interesting tool: i3wm. It's a tilling windows manager targeted for Linux. I have to admit that it's not handy at all. But Guess what? You can literally re-map all shortcuts on your keyboard and such high flexibility would give you a very satisfying experience controlling the system. For example, all terminals can reside in one workspace and it automatically takes up the entire screen and split up if you open another one. It is a counter-intuitive environment and it takes so much time for pre-configuration, but I can see the use case especially for operation-heavy type of work.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



## WEEK-TWELVE

### What did you do this past week?

We finished the project phase 4 on Monday, I did an interview later and pretty much the rest of the week are just relaxing. I also went to a live house; it's the new album tour from The Internet. No more exams, no more interviews - I mean life is just great. 

### What's in your way?

Thanksgiving break! I will be out of town and have some fun. It's really nice to suddenly realize that I have finished almost everything right before the break. Checking the calendar, I know that I will be busy again after I come back; so before that happens, let me just forget about all the stress I had in the past two months.

### What will you do next week?

same as above.

### What was your experience of Project #4? (this question will vary, week to week)

Project 4 is not really too much work for our group. The filter and searching APIs were mostly ready upon the phase 3, so most of the work are actually on the front end. An interesting challenge was that special characters like '-' are treated differently in our searching feature, so we need to somehow catch such scenario and be careful. Another thing is the trouble caused by pagination: in order to search everything, we need to call multiple pages to collect the results, and that is so inconvenient. Overall our work were really smooth, and I just can't wait for the final presentations to see how other groups are doing.

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

As the fall recruiting season approaches the end, I had so many thoughts on how I could possibly do better. My genuine advice is that, don't put too much pressure on yourself. Every time I got rejected by a company, I felt so bad and I was really worried that I'm just not that good. However, interviews become easier and easier as I have more experience with it, and after my first offer I began to realize that I should enjoy this process much more. There are so many good companies hiring people, and you always have another place to apply for. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## WEEK-ELEVEN

### What did you do this past week?

I finished the algo exam earlier this week and had a quite relaxing break. Project was going well as we have met most of the requirements other than the search, so this phase three becomes much easier. I will give credit to my awesome teammates: they are doing such a good job to the degree that I don't need to worry about anything at all.

### What's in your way?

I have two interviews in the next week and I will be going out of town again.  

### What will you do next week?

I will work hard and try to wrap up all my tasks before Wednesday. I have one meeting with our group to complete the rest of phase three, and several other assignments due on Friday. Then I will be heading out on Thursday and hopefully I could do well in the back to back interviews.

### What was your experience in learning SQL? (this question will vary, week to week)

Actually I'm surprised. SQL is so flexible that we may have many ways to do the very same query. I really like the hackerrank sql exercise we did in class; I don't have too much experience writing sql in real life, and this is a great opportunity for me to at least get exposed to sql commands hand by hand. I feel like SQL is somehow closer to English so it makes so much sense just by reading the syntax.  

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

GitKraken. I know there are many git client with graphic interface, yet I particularly like GitKraken for solving merging conflicts. Before knowing GitKraken, for merge conflicts I would usually check into files, fix the issue and remove the header manually etc. This is a terrible experience and it could be so annoying when there are multiple changes written by different people. GitKraken provides a very clean comparison between two files and makes it intuitive to edit and save changes. Other than this, GitKraken also allows you to modify the workflow by draging the commits etc, so this can be useful when I mistakenly did something and not wanted to use reverse the commits all the time. Overall I think installing a git GUI client is a good move; we may not need it in daily simple workflows, yet it could be very handy at times. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------


## WEEK-TEN

### What did you do this past week?

A lot of homework dues. I finished my history essay, math homework, database problem set and algorithm assignment. Besides, the project due took some time of the eariler week and the coming algo exam is taking up my spare time in the weekend. Next week will be much easier for me.  

### What's in your way?

It's the algo exam. I spent too much time interviewing last month and I feel like I need to catch up with so much materials. Later next week I will be expecting a few final round interview results coming out. I'm crossing my fingers... 

### What will you do next week?

Finish the algo exam, pick up the project phase 4 and relax a little bit.

### What was your experience of Project #3? (this question will vary, week to week)

This project phase 3 is where a lot of work comes in. Like back in phase 2 we can totally mock out a static page but this time we need to setup everything right. A lot of collabarations are going on in this phase, as we keep making some subtle changes like modifying database fields and some designing work to make each other's work easier to accomplish. Testing is another part that we were kind of in trouble with; every change we made broke the tests we wrote, so we have to fix all the tests right before the project due and that was a little mess. We were also hitting some production issues that we didn't realize as we were all doing local development independently. Anyway this is a great project phase and I think our team did a great job. We have a solid foundation that we are confident that we can easily build up the phase 4 upon it smoothly.  

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

I am a dropbox user for a long time, yet I didn't realize that I should use it as a workspace. This was the thing: I have my R installed in one of my laptops for my stats class, yet I'm getting so used to the Word to create a homework document. Everytime when I need to take a screenshot I would save it as a file and use an online messenger to pass to my other machine; then I will download it and embed into my document. This is too painful! Then I suddenly realized that dropbox could be good use case in this scenario. No more uploading and downloading; whenever I made a screenshot, I can access that pic from the other machine as long as I set the default saving directory under dropbox. Why didn't I think of this much earlier?  

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## WEEK-NINE

### What did you do this past week?

I finished three assignments in a row and went out since Thursday for an on-site interview. My weekend was much relaxing and I did catch up with our group project on Sunday after I get back in town. This is actually my first experience renting a car during the interview visit, and I absolutely love it. It feels like home already, as I can go wherever I want and change my mind at any moment. It does depend on the city I'm visiting though.

### What's in your way?

Project phase three due is on Tuesday, obviously. We are close to finishing this phase, yet have not begun on the technical report. We just recently noticed the the testing part weights a lot in the grading criteria, and we definitely need to do more meaningful testing. Also the registration for next semester is opening this coming week, and I will spend some time figuring out what courses to take and how to make my schedule doable.  

### What will you do next week?

same as above.

### What did you think of the talk by Dr. Rich and Dr. Cline? (this question will vary, week to week)

The ethics in information technology is something relatively new but important to all of us. We all care about our privacy while active looking for more information at the same time; there are just too much controversy in this field. As a college student that will enter the industry soon, I absolutely feel like it is necessary for us to think through the ethical aspect of what we are doing. Our minds may change over the years, or in certain scenarios it becomes tough to follow what we are supposed to do, but having this mindset of making ethical decisions is very important. Dr. Rich and Dr. Cline did a great job listing some classic examples leading us to think and discuss such situations that we might encounter in the future, which I think is indeed helpful.

### If you went, what did you think of the talk by Atlassian? (this question will vary, week to week)

Atlassian has some well-known products like BitBucket and Confluence. I'm always a big fan of such tech talks; it's interesting to know what is happening behind the products and how the engineering teams develop and operate them. I like to hear stories from the perspective of the insiders, as I can have more understanding when I'm the user. On the other hand, it is a more of a talk on the industry experience. So sad I'm a senior already; I wish I had participated more tech talks when I was a freshman.

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Let me recommend a book here: system design primer. This book is about how to design large scale systems, and the concepts there are very clear and easy to follow. More importantly, the book has only 80 pages; you will have a general understanding on related concepts, and there are always more related links where you can learn more if you are interested in some details. I find this book very inspiring as it covers so many questions deep in my mind. Although we are not likely to design a large system at the early stage of our career, I'm pretty sure you will have a lot of fun reading it.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## WEEK-EIGHT

### What did you do this past week?

This was an another busy week where I almost forgot updating this blog... so I finished a few homework dues and did a couple of interviews as usual. It's an really important week for me because just received my very first offer and that was such a relief! I'm not sure whether I will take this offer, yet there are still a few weeks for me to make an formal decision. I will have to expediate other interview process and withdrawn a certain number of those choices.  

### What's in your way?

Like I said, as the first offer comes, I will try to wrap up all my current interviews really soon. Meanwhile, I have my data management midterm to prepare, this swe project to work on and another on-site interview next week. I know this sounds busy but actually I don't feel pressured at all since I at least got a place to go. I feel like I don't even need to prepare my luggage at all as I just did this two weeks ago and I can easily pack the same stuff again. 

### What will you do next week?

I don't want to keep the entire blog talking about how exciting I am after experiencing the horrible month with dozens of interviews with rejections and finally got an offer. But yeah, I hope I can do well in the rest of interviews and have more choices in hand to compare with. Honestly schooling is my second priority right now, but I will still attend lectures and finish homeworks at my minimum effort. 

### What was your experience of Test #1 (the problems, the time, HackerRank)?

Test is absolutely easy. The first two problems took me a little bit more time than I expected, but then problem 3-6 are basically the same and I think I nailed it pretty fast. I like the variation in the problems as it is a bit different from what we learned from the lecture yet sharing the same concept. HackerRank is no suprise to us thanks to the on class exercise. Or maybe I just did too many online assessments so this platform is no secret to me anymore.

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

I spent quite a lot of time on vSphere client last few days. This is provided by VMware and I think it's a great product! The interfaces are fairly straghtforward and you can manage those vms with very detailed configurations. The desktop version is kind of old school but it's definitely more stable than the web client. The console functionality is very useful just like a virtualbox; before we setup the networking stuff like vlans and router settings etc., console is pretty much the only way we can access the server and change settings inside. The GUI is not slow at all in my experience. Well I think this is of course out of scope in any personal projects, but it can be a useful skill to pick up before entering the industry.

------------------------------------------------------------------
## WEEK-SEVEN

### What did you do this past week?

Finished four interviews in a row. Well seriously I don't remember doing anything else, maybe some homework? I know I have a lot of catch up work to do, yet I've been so unproductive over the weekend. There is one nice thing for this weekend though, I did a really long video chat with my family, like a straight six hours. I should have done this on a regular basis. This semester has been so crazy that I couldn't believe there are so many things going on in seven weeks.      

### What's in your way?

Exam is coming, and I haven't gathered enough time to review the materials. I guess I will make the cheat sheet later tonight and try to browse all notes at least once tomorrow before the exam. Then I will wrap up my history essay before midnight and begin preparing for the interview on Tuesday. I think my calendar has been booked up on this intense pace until mid-November.

### What will you do next week?

Like I said above, exam, homework due and interviews. Later next week I may be able to spend more time working on project phase II, and my team will certainly boost up the progress right after the exam. I hope that my absence on the Tuesday team meeting won't be too bad.

### What was your experience of learning the basics of Python?

This is awesome! I use Python as my primary language in interviews, and I actually benefit from paying attention to the lectures. On one interview I was asked about how to deal with Big Integer, and I suddenly recall professor Downing mentioned that Python has the mechanism that when a number gets large enough, it will automatically store the address of the Big Integer to avoid overflow. I really think this impressed the interviewer and that's part of the reason why I got into the next round. Boy, attending lectures pays off! Other techniques are also very important, as I will gain more understanding of the Python language itself and thus be able to write "pythonic" code. 

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Don't forget to keep track of your background processes... I mean I had several Docker containers running on my Ubuntu box, and I usually never turn off my computer so I have no problem accessing my work there. However, for some reason I accidentally reboot my laptop at one time, and I regret doing it immediately: of course I lost some data on my containers. Well it's definitely a lesson and I shouldn't be relying on the application on the fly; the correct thing to do is to have backup plans or synchronize everything somehow.    

-----------------------------------------------------------


## WEEK-SIX

### What did you do this past week?

Earlier this week we finished the project 2, and then I spent most of the time preparing for the onsite interview on Friday. It is a nice trip but the 4-hour flight is definitely exhausting. I also did a few online assessments and made a detailed plan for this October. I feel like I'm somehow overloaded recently so refactoring my calendar would help me put emphasis on the important stuff. 

### What's in your way?

I'm trying to build our back end system so that we can populate the db through REST calls. I want to keep pace with my teammates while not losing the rhythm of my energy, so starting early is always the safest option. Other than that, I can finally gather some time to catch up with the coursework. Right now I feel good hanging out in a random place without worrying about anything, but I'm pretty sure everything will eventually come to me after I get back in town.

### What will you do next week?

On Monday and Tuesday I will catch up with classes and finish most school work for the rest of the week. Wednesday would be the preparation for the interviews on Thursday and Friday. The weekend is reserved for our group project phase II, also I have an essay due with the first swe test on the coming Monday.

### What was your experience of Project #2? (this question will vary, week to week)

I like it so far. I didn't expect to put in so much time building a simple static website; I guess it's just the design work that takes so much time. My teammates are doing really well and very responsible on their parts, so I'm very glad that we are supporting each other and not procrastinating to the very last moment. Phase II needs a lot more work and I'm so ready to fight through this. 

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

While being proficient in one programming language, we really need a broad range of knowledge to pass interviews. Other than the regular white boarding questions, I was also asked on some language characteristics like JavaScript closures/callbacks and database knowledge like SQL joins. Meanwhile, I got rejected on the final round mainly because I forgot how assembly-level stack works and couldn't analyze what happens when reading a file from a disk in detail. If I had spent two hours or so quickly going over the materials in 429/439, I would at least feel comfortable giving an answer. Friendly reminder: interviews are not just about data structures and algorithms.        

-----------------------------------------------------------

## WEEK-FIVE

### What did you do this past week?

I had a bunch of interviews earlier this week and spent most of my weekend setting up our web application and server stuff. The work on back end server is actually ahead of game here, but I believe it would save us time when it comes to scraping and populating into database.     

### What's in your way?

I will have my first algorithm exam tomorrow. The materials are kind of confusing so I definitely need to figure them out. After that it's the project phase one due, which we already finished most parts of it. 

### What will you do next week?

Well I should be expecting some results from the previous interviews. I really want to take a break at this point, but if I move forward to the onsite interviews that would be even more stressful than the on-campus ones. I always feel like I'm not ready enough for the whiteboard coding, yet I just have to overcome this fear somehow. 

### What's your experience of the readings, so far? And, if you went, what did you think of the talk by Under Armour? (this question will vary, week to week)

Some of the readings are really conceptual, like the UML ones. I didn't dig into some concepts because I feel like they are not quite directly related to our lectures and projects. Of course it is really helpful in terms of my software engineering experience, but I have to admit that I am putting the lecture/project on a much higher priority over the readings so far. As for the tech talk, I'm glad that we always have this kind of opportunity to get some real world information. (And the free attendance quiz!) 

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

I will share my experience with AWS EC2. My first try was on freshman year, and the experience was horrible cos I didn't really know anything about it. Over the few years I've gained some cloud computing experience, yet never work with AWS ever since. This time I notice that the interfaces change a lot, and it still looks like over complicated for someone just started. I guess all the tools are somehow similar once we grab the concept under the hood, so my advice is to try more platforms so that we will know which feature or functionality is important and what specs can we simply ignore.

-----------------------------------------------------------


## WEEK-FOUR

### What did you do this past week?

Career fair! I did spend a lot time preparing for this and of course it was exhausting. Then I finished my first on-campus interview in this semester, and tried hard to catch up with the coursework I've missed. I also participate in our first group meeting for the upcoming web app project. Looks like we are an enthusiastic team planning ahead of time while the project specs is still on the way!

### What's in your way?

A series of interviews coming up. I definitely need to spend more time brushing up the data structure/algorithm materials and do some mock-ups on writing code in a white board. I have done one interview this week, and still I don't really feel comfortable writing using a marker instead of typing in a keyboard. I guess the main difference is that we lose the track of formatting and it becomes significantly harder to insert a statement between two lines that have been written. 

### What will you do next week?

I will certainly miss some classes but I really want to make up for it. So after I'm done with the first-round interviews, I'll probably go over the slides and docs in detail. It will be the end of September now, and I do have plenty of materials to review. This would also save me some time later when the midterm comes up, so that I won't feel screwed and have no time for schooling at all.

### What was your experience of Project #1 (the problem, the overkill requirements of submission, etc.)?

Not too much. I had OOP last semester so this entire experience is quite familiar to me. One thing I do like about it is the CI/CD integration: it is much faster than the Travis.ci that we were using before! The submission is also a little bit different as we are not required to put the details into a json file.

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

Hey I don't know if this is relevant enough, but I do want to share this trick that greatly boosts my energy level recently: change the physical environment frequently. Like you don't necessary have to go to the library or sit right on your desk chair; anywhere, a sofa, under a tree or even holding your paper while randomly walking around. All of this strangely works for me. It might not be as comfortable as my usual study place, but I feel like I can concentrate more and get short tasks done for around half an hour. 


-----------------------------------------------------------

## WEEK-THREE

### What did you do this past week?

What an exhausting week! I attended the engineering expo, did poorly in an interview and finished the first round of assignment dues. I need to get into this rhythm though, as the CNS career fair is on the way and I don't want to screw up another opportunity. Job hunting is hard.

### What's in your way?

Collatz is done; So I have algo homeworks and data management lab to worry about. Meanwhile I want to start early on my stats homework and history essay so that I can save some time for future interviewings. I guess I won't be having any spare time then.

### What will you do next week?

As I said, balance the school works and the interview preps. I still have my weekly routine going, but I might choose to opt out some lectures. Hopefully this will be alright. Sometimes I feel like I'm back to the internship hunting season paired with 439 last semester. It's more pressured this time, yet I can see myself growing and get strong enough to get through this.

### What's your experience of the (in-class exercise) class?

EDIT: Well. For in-class exercise, I have experienced it last semester in OOP. The collaboration part is great as we need to speak out our thought process and try to understand where the other people is getting at. Just like next week's assigned reading for pair programming advice, the in-class exercise at least motivates me to actively participate.   

I like the class as always. Pretty sure the lectures are still similar to the OOP ones, just replacing C++ with Python. It's always good to know those subtle differences between languages and keep brushing up on it. 

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

I know this was mentioned in class, yet I still want to share my experience with docker this week. For my data management class, we were asked to install prosgressql and pgadmin for our homeworks. Personally I use a Ubuntu machine so it turns out that I don't have a desktop version available. I decided to take advantage of my linux system and instead of installing packages one by one, I just pulled a docker image containing all setups. I launched the project in the background and bind a port to the pgadmin interface, and as simple as that I got a working pgadmin just functioning like a normal web page. Seriously I can see the future of docker! No more manual environmental configurations. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


## WEEK-TWO

### What did you do this past week?

Thanks to the labor day vacation, this week feels much shorter. I spent most of my time preparing for my first interview in this semester, and I have not heard anything back yet. I also worked on the Collatz project and finished most of them. Passing the HackerRank is a little tougher than I expected, but I'm glad that I get it over in this weekend.

### What's in your way?

Projects and assignments are out there waiting for my work. I feel like I installed so many tools this week, including the latex setup for algorithm, the R packages for stats, the Gitlab configuration for this class and Postgres/pgadmin for data management. Getting exposed to new things will take some time, and I hope it will be smooth when I actually start using them soon.

### What will you do next week?

I need to finish my homework for algo & database before Wednesday and then definetely add the unit/acceptance tests with formatting stuff to close the Collatz project. Meanwhile, I will probably hand in my resume to a few companys in the engineering career fair to see if there's more opportunity. Of course the CNS one would be huge the week after and nobody wants to miss that, so the engineering one next week could be a good place to have some tastes.

### What's your experience of the class?

It's pretty good. Since I took the OOP last semester, most of the content this week sounds kind of familiar to me. Comparing to the lectures, I'm more excited on what would happen for the group project. How many hours should I expect to spend with my teammates? What are we building and what would it look like? As for the Collatz project experience, I find the Gitlab CI very easy to use. I didn't even have to modify the configuration file at all, and it pulls of my changes and finishes the testing in literally two minutes.   

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

The Overleaf platform. I was kind of trying to avoid the LaTex work earlier in my college career, yet the requirement that I have to type my homework leaves me no choice now. So the Overleaf platform is free and we can save our projects online without worring about losing the data at all. I can also access it whichever laptop I'm using. In terms of the functunality, the dual view makes the compiling & preview much simpler. What I need to do is simply copy and paste the symbols from the raw Tex source based on the preview, so we won't be scrolling in Word to find out a no-name-symbol among tons of similar ones any more. Yay!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

## WEEK-ONE

### What did you do this past week?

It's the first week so a lot of new things going on. I finalized my course selections and began getting used to the new schedule I have in this semester. Most of my college friends are getting back in town earlier this week, so I got some chance to hang out with them and met some new people. It's pretty awesome. I'm so ready for this new start.

### What's in your way?

As I'm becoming a rising senior, the job hunting is definitely the task staying on top of my priority list. Career fairs are coming in a few weeks so I need to get ready for the interview stuff, including updating my resume, looking for opportunities and brush up my coding skills etc. Meanwhile I just got started on my part-time job, which also requires me to put in more effort at the beginning. So I guess I will figure out how to balance my life as I go.

### What will you do next week?

Just the transition from the relaxing summer mode to a busy working mode. I like this labor day long weekend so that I can adjust a bit and make up some plans. Going over all my syllabi for this semester, I realize that this CS373 is probably the most time consuming class for me. I'm not too worried about the workload since I already have some experience doing web dev things, yet I think I still need to reach out to find and get to know my teammates a bit.

### What are your expectations of the class?

The most exciting part should be the collaboration on the group project. I enjoy doing an independent project as we will have the freedom to design and implement anything we want from scratch, which brings in a great sense of accomplishment. Also I decided to use Python for most of my interviews, so the lecture will certainly be helpful in this perspective. Lastly, I enjoy professor Downing's lectures very much ever since the first week of OOP I took last semester, so this class should be at least as enjoyable as I expected.   

### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

I didn't know that Gitlab has this CI thing built-in already. This is so cool. I can't wait to try it out pretty soon, as the previous experience using Travis.ci is not as smooth as I expected it to be. This summer I got in touch with Jenkins, which is quite flexible and works fine. So I guess I'm in a good place to start comparing these tools and summarize what is my preferrence and how these tools differ in terms of automation in a general way.
